# Project E — PR Readiness & Security Dashboard

## Overview
A 175-hour GSoC project focused on giving contributors and maintainers a clear view of **PR readiness, CI/CD status, and discussion/reviewer insights**. Integrates security-focused checks to ensure high-quality contributions.

## Goals
- Aggregate CI/CD results from GitHub Actions and other check-runs.
- Analyze PR discussions to classify **actionable vs non-actionable comments**.
- Detect reviewer intent (blocking vs suggestions vs nitpicks).
- Include basic **security scanning status** per PR (SAST, DAST, Secret Scan, Dependency Scan).
- Provide contributors with a **single dashboard** view:
  - READY / ACTION_REQUIRED / CI_FAILING
  - Security warnings or flagged issues
  - Resolved vs unresolved comments

> Note: This is a preliminary design to illustrate the dashboard layout and key elements.

## Security & Bug Focus
- Highlight PRs with **failing security checks**.
- Track **vulnerabilities** detected by integrated SAST/DAST tools.
- Ensure contributors are aware of **potential risky changes** before merge.
- Optional: Integrate with BLT Security Bot for **AI-assisted remediation suggestions**.

## Benefits
- Helps contributors identify exactly what needs attention before merge.
- Maintainers get a **quick overview** of PR quality and potential security issues.
- Reduces human error in reviewing PRs for both functionality and security.
- Can be extended post-GSoC with integration into **SOC dashboards** and **BACON reward system**.
